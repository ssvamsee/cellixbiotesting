                     <p className="WWDP">Founded in 2014, we are the leading drug discovery and development company. We generate our own drug design data before combining the critical power of AI with the creativity of involving proprietary platform technology, Synergix AI<sup>TM</sup> and expertise of our world-class scientists. This allows us to shorten the pre-clinical drug discovery stage and, in turn, substantially accelerate the delivery of new treatments to patients worldwide. By reducing the number of compounds analysed, we aim to vividly reduce the time and cost of discovering and developing new medicines. Cellix Bio balances Synergix AI<sup>TM</sup> plus human creativity in the drug discovery.</p>

                     <p className="WWDP">Our targeted discovery process enables the creation of new markets and solutions to both old and new problems. Driven by the speed and accuracy of our platform, Synergix AI<sup>TM</sup> accomplishes in months what previously took years, saving tens of millions in research and development costs. Each of our lead candidates are unique with powerful therapeutic benefits. The molecular entities that we discover are the first of their kind and patented.</p>

                     <p className="WWDP">Using our Synergix AI<sup>TM</sup> drug discovery platform and the insights from our successful drug development and clinical data, we can identify synergistic pharmacology between bio-actives, combining them to address disease related biochemical pathways and targets. However the rubrics of drug discovery are very complex - not all are known and some are not readily describable as a restricted set of moves.</p>
